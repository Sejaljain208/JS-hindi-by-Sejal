/* difference text file and js file  
    A text file is a simple file that contains plain text without any special formatting or functionality. It is typically used for storing notes, documentation, or any other type of unstructured information. Text files usually have a .txt extension.      
    and 
    in js file we write javascript code which is used to create dynamic and interactive web pages. JavaScript files have a .js extension and can be linked to HTML files to add functionality to web pages.
