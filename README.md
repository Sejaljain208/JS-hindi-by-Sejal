Chapter 1: Variables & Declarations
Example (Internal JS)
(JavaScript – Learn Everything Serie )

🧠 What are Variables?
Variables are containers that hold data.
They help us store, reuse, and update information in JavaScript — from simple values like
numbers to complex data like arrays and objects.
Think of a variable as a box with a name on it. You can put something inside it (a value), and later
check or change what's inside.
In JavaScript, you create these boxes using keywords: var , let , or const .

🧪 var, let, and const – Line-by-Line Comparison
🧓 var – Old and risky
Scoped to functions, not blocks
Can be redeclared and reassigned
Hoisted to the top with undefined value

let – Modern and safe
Scoped to blocks ( {} )
Can be reassigned but not redeclared
Hoisted, but stays in the Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ)
var score = 10;
var score = 20; // OK

🔐 const – Constant values
Scoped to blocks
Cannot be reassigned or redeclared
Value must be assigned at declaration
TDZ applies here too

👉 But: If const holds an object/array, you can still change its contents:

🔥 Scope in Real Life
Block Scope → Code inside {} like in loops, if , etc.
Function Scope → Code inside a function
let and const follow block scope.
var ignores block scope — which leads to bugs.
let age = 25;
age = 30; // ✅
let age = 40; // ❌ Error (same block)


const PI = 3.14;
PI = 3.14159; // ❌ Error


const student = { name: "Riya" };
student.name = "Priya"; // ✅ OK
student = {}; // ❌ Error


🧨 Hoisting
JavaScript prepares memory before running code.
It moves all declarations to the top — this is called hoisting.
But:
var is hoisted and set to undefined
let and const are hoisted but not initialized — so accessing them early gives
ReferenceError

⚠️ Common Confusions (JS Reality Checks)
const doesn't make things fully constant. It protects the variable, not the value.
var is outdated — it's better to use let and const .
{
var x = 5;
let y = 10;
const z = 15;
}
console.log(x); // ✅ 5
console.log(y); // ❌ ReferenceError
console.log(z); // ❌ ReferenceError

console.log(a); // undefined
var a = 10;

console.log(b); // ❌ ReferenceError
let b = 20;

let and const behave similarly, but const gives more safety — use it when you're not
planning to reassign.

🧠 Mindset Rule

🧪 Practice Zone
. Declare your name and city using const , and your age using let .
. Try this and observe the result:

. Guess the output:

. Create a const object and add a new key to it — does it work?
. Try accessing a let variable before declaring it — what error do you see?
. Change a const array by pushing a value. Will it throw an error?
. Use const by default. Use let only when you plan to change the value.
. Avoid var — it belongs to the past.
let x = 5;
let x = 10;
console.log(count);
var count = 42;

🧠 Chapter 2: Data Types + Type System

(JavaScript – Learn Everything Series)

📦 What Are Data Types?
In JavaScript, every value has a type.
These types define what kind of data is being stored — a number, text, boolean, object, etc.
There are two categories:
Primitive types – stored directly.
Reference types – stored as memory references.

🔹 Primitive Data Types
. String → Text
"hello" , 'Sheryians'
. Number → Any numeric value
3 , -99 , 3.14
. Boolean → True or false
true , false
. Undefined → Variable declared but not assigned
let x; → x is undefined
. Null → Intentional empty value
let x = null;
. Symbol → Unique identifier (rarely used)
. BigInt → Very large integers
123456789012345678901234567890n

🔹 Reference Data Types
Object → { name: "Harsh", age: 26 }

Array → [10, 20, 30]
Function → function greet() {}
These are not copied directly, but by reference.

🔍 typeof Operator
Used to check the data type of a value:

Note: typeof null === "object" is a bug, but has existed since the early days of JS.

🔁 Type Coercion (Auto-Conversion)
JavaScript auto-converts types in some operations:

🚨 Loose vs Strict Equality

typeof "Sher" // "string"
typeof 99 // "number"
typeof true // "boolean"
typeof undefined // "undefined"
typeof null // "object" ← known bug
typeof [] // "object"
typeof {} // "object"
typeof function(){} // "function"

"5" + 1 // "51" → number converted to string
"5" - 1 // 4 → string converted to number
true + 1 // 2
null + 1 // 1
undefined + 1 // NaN

== compares value with type conversion
=== compares value + type (no conversion)

Always prefer === for accurate comparisons.

🧪 NaN – Not a Number

Even though it means “Not a Number”, NaN is actually of type number .
This is because operations like 0 / 0 or parseInt("abc") still produce a numeric result —
just an invalid one.

🔦 Truthy and Falsy Values
Falsy values:
false , 0 , "" , null , undefined , NaN
Everything else is truthy, including:
"0" , "false" , [] , {} , function(){}
Example:
5 == "5" // true
5 === "5" // false

typeof NaN // "number"

if ("0") {
console.log("Runs"); // "0" is a non-empty string = truthy
}

🧠 Mindset
JavaScript will often auto-convert types behind the scenes.
Always stay aware of what data type you’re working with.

❓ Common Confusions
typeof null is "object" — this is a bug.
undefined means the variable was never assigned.
null means you intentionally set it to "nothing".
'5' + 1 is "51" but '5' - 1 is 4 .

🧪 Practice Zone
. Predict the output:
. Check types:
. Truthy or Falsy?

console.log(null + 1);
console.log("5" + 3);
console.log("5" - 3);
console.log(true + false);

console.log(typeof []);
console.log(typeof null);
console.log(typeof 123n);

. Write a function isEmpty(value) that checks if a given value is null , undefined , or "" .
. Compare with loose vs strict:
console.log(Boolean(0)); // falsy
console.log(Boolean("0")); // truthy
console.log(Boolean([])); // truthy
console.log(Boolean(undefined));// falsy

console.log(5 == "5"); // ?
console.log(5 === "5"); // ?

🔄 Chapter 3: Operators

(JavaScript – Learn Everything Series )

🔧 What are Operators?
Operators are special symbols or keywords in JavaScript used to perform operations on values
(operands).
You’ll use them in calculations, comparisons, logic, assignments, and even type checks.
Think of them as the verbs of your code — they act on data.

➕ Arithmetic Operators
Used for basic math.
+ // addition
- // subtraction
* // multiplication
Example:

🧮 Assignment Operators
Assign values to variables.

Example:

🧾 Comparison Operators
Used in condition checks.
/ // division
% // modulus (remainder)
** // exponentiation (power)

let a = 10, b = 3;
console.log(a + b); // 13
console.log(a % b); // 1
console.log(2 ** 3); // 8

= // assigns value
+= // a += b => a = a + b
-= // a -= b
*=, /=, %=

let score = 5;
score += 2; // score = 7

Example:

✅ Logical Operators
Used to combine multiple conditions.

Example:

🌀 Unary Operators
Used on a single operand.
== // equal (loose)
=== // equal (strict – value + type)
!= // not equal (loose)
!== // not equal (strict)
> < >= <=

console.log(5 == "5"); // true
console.log(5 === "5"); // false

&& // AND – both must be true
|| // OR – either one true
! // NOT – negates truthiness

let age = 20, hasID = true;
if (age >= 18 && hasID) {
console.log("Allowed");
}

Example:

❓ Ternary Operator (Conditional)
Shorthand for if...else

Example:
🧪 typeof Operator
+ // tries to convert to number
- // negates
++ // increment
-- // decrement
typeof // returns data type

let x = "5";
console.log(+x); // 5 (converted to number)

condition ? valueIfTrue : valueIfFalse

let score = 80;
let grade = score > 50 ? "Pass" : "Fail";

typeof 123 // "number"
typeof "hi" // "string"
typeof null // "object" (JS bug)
typeof [] // "object"


🧠 Mindset
Operators make logic happen.
They help you make decisions, combine values, and create expressions.
Try to:
Use === instead of == to avoid type bugs.
Use ternary for quick decisions, not complex ones.
Think in truthy/falsy when using && , || , ! .

❓ Common Confusions
"5" + 1 is "51" (string concat), but "5" - 1 is 4 (number subtract)
!!value is a quick trick to convert anything into a boolean
Pre-increment ( ++i ) vs post-increment ( i++ ) return different results

🧪 Practice Zone
. Predict:

. Convert using unary +
typeof {} // "object"
typeof function(){} // "function"

console.log("10" + 1);
console.log("10" - 1);
console.log(true + false);
console.log(!!"Sheryians");

. Use ternary:

. Build a calculator:

. Score logic:
let str = "42";
let num = +str;
console.log(num); // 42

let age = 17;
let msg = age >= 18 ? "Adult" : "Minor";

// Using switch + arithmetic operators
function calc(a, b, operator) {
// +, -, *, /
}

js
let marks = 82;
// Print "Excellent", "Good", "Average", or "Fail" based on ranges

🧭 Chapter 4: Control Flow

(JavaScript – Learn Everything Series)


🚦 What is Control Flow?
Control flow decides which code runs, when it runs, and how many times it runs.
It's like decision-making + direction in your JavaScript program.
If operators are the verbs, control flow is the traffic signal.

🧱 if, else if, else

✅ Example:

🌀 switch-case
Great for checking one variable against many values.

if (condition) {
// runs if condition is true
} else if (anotherCondition) {
// runs if first was false, second is true
} else {
// runs if none are true
}

let marks = 78;
if (marks >= 90) {
console.log("A");
} else if (marks >= 75) {
console.log("B");
} else {
console.log("C");
}

✅ Example:

🔁 Early Return Pattern
Used in functions to exit early if some condition fails.
switch (value) {
case value1:
// code
break;
case value2:
// code
break;
default:
// fallback
}

js
let fruit = "apple";
switch (fruit) {
case "banana":
console.log("Yellow");
break;
case "apple":
console.log("Red");
break;
default:
console.log("Unknown");
}

function checkAge(age) {
if (age < 18) return "Denied";
return "Allowed";
}

This avoids deep nesting and makes logic cleaner.

⚠️ Common Confusions
switch-case executes all cases after a match unless you break
else if chain works top-down — order matters
You can use truthy/falsy values directly in if

🧠 Mindset
Control flow = conditional storytelling.
It helps your program make choices and respond differently to different inputs.
Write readable branches. Avoid nesting too deep — use early return if needed.

🧪 Practice Zone
. Student grade logic:
. Rock-paper-scissors:
. Login message:

// Write a program that prints A, B, C, D, or F based on marks
// Given player1 and player2's choice, print winner or draw

. Weather advice:

. Age checker:
let isLoggedIn = true;
let isAdmin = false;
// Show different messages based on combination

let weather = "rainy";
// Use switch-case to print what to wear

// Return "Kid", "Teen", "Adult", or "Senior"

🔁 Chapter 5: Loops
(JavaScript – Learn Everything Series)

🔄 Why Loops?
Loops help us repeat code without rewriting it.
If a task needs to be done multiple times (e.g., printing 1–10, going through an array, or
checking each character in a string), loops are the backbone.

🔁 for Loop

Start from i = 0
Run till i < 5
Increase i each time

🔁 while Loop
Condition is checked before running

🔁 do-while Loop
Runs at least once, even if condition is false

for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
console.log(i);
}

let i = 0;
while (i < 5) {
console.log(i);
i++;
}

let i = 0;
do {
console.log(i);
i++;
} while (i < 5);

⛔ break and continue
break : Exit loop completely
continue : Skip current iteration and move to next

🌀 for-of – Arrays & Strings
Works on anything iterable (arrays, strings)

🧱 forEach – Arrays
Cleaner than for for arrays, but you can’t break/return

for (let i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
if (i === 3) continue;
console.log(i); // Skips 3
}

for (let char of "Sheryians") {
console.log(char);
}

let nums = [10, 20, 30];
nums.forEach((num) => {
console.log(num);
});

🧱 for-in – Objects (and arrays if needed)
Goes over keys in objects

⚠️ Common Confusions
for-in is for objects, not arrays (may cause issues with unexpected keys)
forEach can't use break or continue
while and do-while work best when number of iterations is unknown

🧠 Mindset
Loops = data processor.
Use the right loop for the job:
for = best for numbers/indexes
for-of = for array values
for-in = for object keys
while = for unpredictable conditions

🧪 Practice Zone
. Print 1 to 10 using for
. Print even numbers between 1 to 20
. Reverse a string using loop
js
let user = { name: "Harsh", age: 26 };
for (let key in user) {
console.log(key, user[key]);
}

. Sum of all numbers in an array
. Print all characters of a name using for-of
. Print all object keys and values using for-in
. Use continue to skip a specific number
. Guess number game – use while to ask until correct
. Pattern: Print triangle using *
. Sum of even numbers in an array using forEach

🧮 Chapter 6: Functions

🧠 What are Functions?
Functions are blocks of reusable logic.
Instead of repeating the same task again and again, wrap it in a function and reuse it with
different inputs.
Think of a function like a vending machine:
Input: you give money + item code
Output: it gives you the item
Logic: hidden inside

️ Function Declarations
You define it once, then call it whenever needed.

🧾 Parameters vs Arguments
name is a parameter
"Harsh" is the argument you pass

🌀 Return Values
return sends back a result to wherever the function was called
After return , function exits

🧰 Function Expressions
function greet() {
console.log("Welcome to Sheryians!");
}
greet();

function greet(name) {
console.log("Hello " + name);
}
greet("Harsh");

function sum(a, b) {
return a + b;
}
let total = sum(5, 10); // total is 15

Functions stored in variables
Cannot be hoisted (you can’t call them before they’re defined)

🏹 Arrow Functions
Cleaner syntax
No own this , no arguments object

🧂 Default + Rest + Spread
const greet = function () {
console.log("Hello!");
};

const greet = () => {
console.log("Hi!");
};

function multiply(a = 1, b = 1) {
return a * b;
}
function sum(...nums) {
return nums.reduce((acc, val) => acc + val, 0);
}
let nums = [1, 2, 3];
console.log(sum(...nums)); // Spread

a = 1 → default parameter
...nums → rest parameter
...nums (in call) → spread operator

🎯 First-Class Functions
JavaScript treats functions as values:
Assign to variables
Pass as arguments
Return from other functions

🧠 Higher-Order Functions (HOF)
Functions that accept other functions or return functions.

function shout(msg) {
return msg.toUpperCase();
}
function processMessage(fn) {
console.log(fn("hello"));
}
processMessage(shout);

function createMultiplier(x) {
return function (y) {
return x * y;
};
}
let double = createMultiplier(2);
console.log(double(5)); // 10

🔐 Closures & Lexical Scope
Closures = when a function remembers its parent scope, even after the parent has finished.
Even after outer is done, counter still remembers count .

⚡ IIFE – Immediately Invoked Function Expression
Used to create private scope instantly.

🚀 Hoisting: Declarations vs Expressions

function outer() {
let count = 0;
return function () {
count++;
console.log(count);
};
}
let counter = outer();
counter(); // 1
counter(); // 2

(function () {
console.log("Runs immediately");
})();

hello(); // works
function hello() {
console.log("Hi");
}


Declarations are hoisted
Expressions are not

⚠️ Common Confusions
Arrow functions don’t have their own this
You can’t break out of forEach
Closures often trap old variable values
Return vs console.log – don't mix them up

🧠 Mindset
Functions are your logic blocks + memory holders (via closure).
They keep your code clean, DRY, and reusable.

🧪 Practice Zone
. Write a BMI calculator function
. Create a greet function with default name
. Sum all numbers using rest parameter
. Create a closure counter function
. Write a function that returns another function
. Use a function to log even numbers in array
. Create a pure function to add tax
greet(); // error
const greet = function () {
console.log("Hi");
}

. Use IIFE to show welcome message
. Write a discount calculator (HOF style)
. Make a toUpperCase transformer using HOF

🧰 Chapter 7: Arrays
(JavaScript – Learn Everything Series )

🧠 What is an Array?
An array is like a row of boxes, where each box holds a value and has an index (0, 1, 2...).
Arrays help you store multiple values in a single variable — numbers, strings, or even
objects/functions.

️ Creating & Accessing Arrays

Indexing starts from 0
You can access, update, or overwrite values by index

let fruits = ["apple", "banana", "mango"];

let marks = [90, 85, 78];
console.log(marks[1]); // 85
marks[2] = 80; // Update index 2

⚙️ Common Array Methods
🧱 Modifiers (Change original array)
🔍 Extractors (Don't modify original array)
🔄 Iteration Methods
map()
Returns a new array with modified values.

filter()

let arr = [1, 2, 3, 4];
arr.push(5); // Add to end
arr.pop(); // Remove last
arr.shift(); // Remove first
arr.unshift(0); // Add to start
arr.splice(1, 2); // Remove 2 items starting at index 1
arr.reverse(); // Reverse order


let newArr = arr.slice(1, 3); // Copy from index 1 to 2
arr.sort(); // Lexical sort by default


let prices = [100, 200, 300];
let taxed = prices.map(p => p * 1.18);

Filters out elements based on a condition.
reduce()
Reduces the array to a single value.

forEach()
Performs an action for each element (but returns undefined).

find(), some(), every()

✂️ Destructuring & Spread

let nums = [1, 2, 3, 4];
let even = nums.filter(n => n % 2 === 0);

let total = nums.reduce((acc, val) => acc + val, 0);

nums.forEach(n => console.log(n));

nums.find(n => n > 2); // First match
nums.some(n => n > 5); // At least one true
nums.every(n => n > 0); // All true

let [first, second] = ["a", "b", "c"];
let newArr = [...nums, 99]; // Spread to copy & add

⚠️ Common Confusions
splice changes original array, slice does not
forEach vs map : map returns a new array
sort() converts values to strings unless compareFn is provided:

Use:

🧠 Mindset
Arrays are structured, transformable data.
You loop over them, transform them, filter them, or reduce them — all to control what shows up
in your UI or logic.

🧪 Practice Zone
. Create an array of student names and print each
. Filter even numbers from an array
. Map prices to include GST (18%)
. Reduce salaries to calculate total payroll
. Find the first student with grade A
. Write a function to reverse an array
. Sort array of ages in ascending order
js
[10, 2, 3].sort(); // [10, 2, 3] → ["10", "2", "3"] → wrong order

js
arr.sort((a, b) => a - b); // Correct numeric sort

. Destructure first two elements of an array
. Use some() to check if any student failed
. Use spread to copy and add new item

🧱 Chapter 8: Objects

(JavaScript – Learn Everything Series )

🧠 What is an Object?
Objects in JavaScript are like real-world records – a collection of key-value pairs.
They help us store structured data (like a student, a product, or a user profile).

🔑 Key-Value Structure
Keys are always strings (even if you write them as numbers or identifiers)
Values can be anything – string, number, array, object, function, etc.

let student = {
name: "Ravi",
age: 21,
isEnrolled: true
};

console.log(student["name"]); // Ravi
console.log(student.age); // 21

📍 Dot vs Bracket Notation
Use dot notation for fixed key names
Use bracket notation for dynamic or multi-word keys

️ Nesting and Deep Access
Objects can have nested objects (objects inside objects)

✂️ Object Destructuring
You can extract values directly:

For nested objects:

student["full name"] = "Ravi Kumar"; // ✅
student.course = "JavaScript"; // ✅

let user = {
name: "Amit",
address: {
city: "Delhi",
pincode: 110001
}
};
console.log(user.address.city); // Delhi

let { name, age } = student;

🔁 Looping Through Objects
for-in loop

Object.keys(), Object.values(), Object.entries()

📦 Copying Objects
Shallow Copy (one level deep)

Deep Copy (nested levels)

let {
address: { city }
} = user;

for (let key in student) {
console.log(key, student[key]);
}

Object.keys(student); // ["name", "age", "isEnrolled"]
Object.entries(student); // [["name", "Ravi"], ["age", 21], ...]

let newStudent = { ...student };
let newOne = Object.assign({}, student);

let deepCopy = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(user));

❓ Optional Chaining
Avoids errors if a nested property is undefined:

🧠 Computed Properties
You can use variables as keys:

⚠️ Common Confusions
Shallow copy copies only the first level
for-in includes inherited keys (be cautious!)
delete obj.key removes the property
Spread ≠ deep copy

🧠 Mindset
❗ Note: JSON-based copy works only for plain data (no functions, undefined, etc.)

js
console.log(user?.address?.city); // Delhi
console.log(user?.profile?.email); // undefined (no error)

js
let key = "marks";
let report = {
[key]: 89
};

part 2 : DOM  
JavaScript DOM (Document Object Model)
What is DOM?
The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface that allows JavaScript to access and manipulate HTML elements of a webpage.
When a browser loads an HTML page, it converts the page into a tree structure called the DOM Tree.

DOM Tree Structure
The browser represents HTML elements like a hierarchy:
Document
 └── html
     ├── head
     └── body
         ├── h1
         └── p
JavaScript uses this structure to modify the webpage dynamically.

1)Selecting Elements
Before changing anything, elements must be selected.

document.getElementById("id");
document.getElementsByClassName("class");
document.getElementsByTagName("tag");
document.querySelector("selector");
document.querySelectorAll("selector");

2)Text / Content Access
Used to read or update text or HTML content.
element.innerText
element.textContent
element.innerHTML

Example:
heading.innerText = "Hello World";

)Attribute Manipulation
Manage attributes like id, class, src, href, etc.

element.getAttribute("name");
element.setAttribute("name", "value");
element.removeAttribute("name");

4)Dynamic DOM Manipulation
Create, add, or remove elements dynamically.

document.createElement("tag");
parent.appendChild(element);
parent.prepend(element);
parent.removeChild(element);

5)Style Updates
Direct Style
element.style.color = "red";
element.style.backgroundColor = "yellow";

Using ClassList
element.classList.add("className");
element.classList.remove("className");
element.classList.toggle("className");
